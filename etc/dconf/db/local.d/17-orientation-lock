# On quite many notebooks the screen just randomly rotates. This is too much
# fun, especially in exam situations. There are probably some bugs in GNOME,
# iio-sensor-proxy or systemd, e.g.:

# https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7151
# While this stack is so fragile and buggy we better disable automatic screen
# orientation in GNOME via this setting.
